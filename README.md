# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Data-Science-Project
MSC Data Science Final project on Chronic kidney disease 

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction 
Project Objectives:
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data. The key goals include..

Early detection of CKD to prevent disease progression.
Analysis of key clinical features such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels to predict the likelihood of CKD.
Comparison of various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM etc.) to identify the most accurate prediction model.
Data Source
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains clinical data for patients. The key features include:

Age
Blood Pressure
Blood Glucose Levels
Creatinine Levels
Albumin
Red Blood Cell Count
Hemoglobin
Serum Creatinine
